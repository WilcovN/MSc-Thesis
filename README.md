# MSc-Thesis

This repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks designed to segment and analyse the experiments created by Wilco van Nes and Tsai-Ying Chen using Python. 
Each notebook is independently documented with its name refering to internal experiments that have a detailed explanations of logic, methodology, and the environment used.
All code was written to work on Intel CPU's.

For the spatoptemporal analysis the code
Segmentation code/TYC70_markov_phenotyping.ipynb
Is most developed
